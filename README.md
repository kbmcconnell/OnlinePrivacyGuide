# üî∂ Purpose
Corporations, through surveillance capitalism, harvest your personal information for profit. That data is often gathered without your explicit informed consent through complex terms & conditions, features such as personalized recommendations, and more. These tactics ensure you don‚Äôt understand the breadth of data being collected, how it‚Äôs being used, or who gets access to it.

As we‚Äôve seen, data collected by corporations often ends up in data breaches; [AT&T](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/at-t-data-breach-what-is-at-t-doing-for-the-73-million-accounts-breached/), [Change Healthcare](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/21/change-healthcare-cyberattack/), and [Ticketmaster](https://www.pcmag.com/news/ticketmaster-confirms-user-email-addresses-phone-numbers-stolen-in-hack) to name a few. Why should we trust them to dutifully care for our information, when there aren‚Äôt consequences when they lose it?

You deserve to control access to your personal information - who gets it, when it‚Äôs given, how it‚Äôs used, and for how long. This guide will help you get started. If you want a more thorough guide, check out [The Hitchhiker‚Äôs Guide to Online Anonymity](https://anonymousplanet.org/guide.html).

***Disclaimer: I‚Äôm not an expert on every topic here - there are gaps in my knowledge. It‚Äôs up to you to understand the tools you use.***

# üî∂ TL;DR
There is a lot of information in this guide, so below is a succinct list of recommendations. I think the following will have the largest impact on improving your privacy and security:

- Privacy-focused browser
  - **user-friendly:** Firefox with DuckDuckGo & uBlock Origin
  - **best for privacy:** Tor with DuckDuckGo
    - VPNs and extensions are not recommended with Tor
- ‚ÄúNo user logs‚Äù VPN
  - **user-friendly:** NordVPN or Proton
  - **best for privacy:** Mullvad
- Password manager
  - **user-friendly:** NordPass or 1Password
  - **offers free tier:** Bitwarden
- Enable MFA / 2FA on everything
- Social media
  - **best:** delete them
  - **good:** remove personal information & make accounts private
- Remove your personal information from data broker databases
- Opt out of third party cookies, AI training, website tracking, and data & location services
- Use applications/software that have end to end encryption (E2EE)

# üî∂ Reduce Publicly Available Data
Try Googling yourself and look at the results. What did you find?

Publicly available information about you can be used:

- in targeted ads
- to [dox you](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing#:~:text=Doxing%20or%20doxxing%20is%20the,Internet%20and%20without%20their%20consent.)
- to stalk or harass you
- against you politically or socially
  - your sexual orientation, political affiliation, or gender identity

## üî∏ Social Media
Here are some suggestions you can apply to all of your social media accounts:

- remove personal details such as your employer, full name, relatives, gender identity, significant others, sexual orientation, etc
- avoid sharing detailed personal information in social media comments
- opt out of data sharing
- block access to your location
- block access to your address book
- disable cross-website tracking
- disable third party cookies
- make your profiles private

## üî∏ Public Records
Depending on your location and situation, you may request your public records be hidden from public-facing websites run by local, county, and state-wide entities.

## üî∏ Data sharing
Outside of social media, most websites you have an account with have privacy settings. For sites that allow it, opt out of third-party data sharing.

## üî∏ Unused accounts
If you have accounts on websites that you‚Äôre no longer active on, deactivate or delete them. Before deletion, you may need to request your information be removed from their database. Deleting unused accounts will shrink your digital footprint.

## üî∏ Data brokers
Data brokers collect information about you to sell. People finder sites are a type of [data broker](https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/what-know-about-people-search-sites-sell-your-information). You can manually request your information be deleted or pay for a removal service to contact them on your behalf. US government agencies [buy your location data](https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24312313/ftc-bans-sensitive-location-data-brokers-gravy-analytics-venntel-mobilewalla) from brokers.

Most, if not all, people finder sites include a ‚Äúknown associates‚Äù section of your user profile, meaning the personal details of close friends, significant others, housemates, and others can easily be linked to you.

Start here:

- [modify your Google Activity settings](https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity)
- [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com)
  - turn off YouTube history
  - turn off personalization
  - turn off location tracking
- [opt out of prescreen offers](https://www.optoutprescreen.com/)

### üî∏ Manual data removal
**Pros:** 
- free
- most effective
- you control the information you share with the data brokers

**Cons:** 
- time-consuming
- requires regular follow up
- not 100% effective

- [Privacy Guides | Data Removal Services](https://www.privacyguides.org/en/data-broker-removals/)

### üî∏ Paid data removal

**What to look for:** How many data brokers they contact, reputation, and reporting.

**Pros:** 
- significantly less time-consuming
- most offer regular reporting

**Cons:**
- ongoing subscription
- you will likely have to manually reach out to some data brokers anyway
- service may unintentionally provide data brokers too much of your information

# üî∂ Web Browsing
Your ISP (internet service provider), phone apps, cellular provider, web browser, and websites all see some amount of information about you when you use their services.

## üî∏ Browsers

### üîπ Chrome
Chrome is not recommended for privacy. Google [harvests vast swaths of data](https://www.wired.com/story/google-chrome-browser-data/), and Chrome will [disable ad blockers](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/15/24270981/google-chrome-ublock-origin-phaseout-manifest-v3-ad-blocker) with manifest v3.

If you must use Chrome, here are some recommendations:

- use a VPN
- turn off everything related to ads and tracking
- change the default search engine to DuckDuckGo or another of your preference
- turn on secure browsing
- [advanced security settings](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/10468685?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop)
- uBlock Origin Lite extension once uBlock Origin is disabled
- use a password manager
- block / reject third party cookies

### üîπ Safari
Apple does not allow you to uninstall Safari. If you want to use another browser, you only need to change the default browser in your settings.

If you must use Safari, here are some recommendations:

- use a VPN
- change the default search engine to DuckDuckGo or another of your preference
- turn off everything related to ads and tracking
- block / reject third party cookies
- turn on hide your IP
- uBlock Origin
- use a password manager

Many privacy settings can be found [here](https://support.apple.com/en-mz/guide/safari/sfri35610/mac).

### üîπ Edge
Much like Apple with Safari, Microsoft does not allow you to uninstall Edge. If you use another browser, I recommend the following:

- [change the browser used in taskbar search](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSIyvUFdoyc)
- disable Edge background services
- disable startup features
- block tracking you while you use other browsers: 

If you use Edge, here are some recommendations:

- turn on tracking prevention
- turn on send ‚Äúdo not track‚Äù requests
- turn off optional diagnostic data
- you need to have optional diagnostic data turned off in your Windows settings
- turn off personalization & advertising
- use uBlock Origin
- change the default search engine to DuckDuckGo or another of your preference
- use a VPN
- password manager (instead of saving them in the browser)

More settings and information can be found [here](https://fingerprint.com/blog/edge-privacy-security-guide/).

### üîπ Tor Browser
Download [here](https://www.torproject.org/download/).

**Pros:**
- best for privacy
- best for anonymity
- doesn‚Äôt require a VPN (in fact a VPN is not recommended)
- [mitigates fingerprinting](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/anti-fingerprinting/)

**Cons:**
- add-ons/extensions not recommended, they might break the browser or compromise your privacy
- slower performance

### üîπ Firefox
Download [here](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/).

**Pros:**
- good choice for privacy
- user friendly
- near feature parity with Chrome
- supports many add-ons and extensions

**Cons:**
- smaller selection of extensions than Chrome
- less user friendly than Chrome

### üîπ Brave
Download [here](https://brave.com/).

**Pros:**
- great for privacy
- blocks ads by default
- [mitigates fingerprinting](https://brave.com/privacy-updates/3-fingerprint-randomization/)

**Cons:**
- crypto settings turned on by default
- small selection of extensions
- websites might break due to its strict privacy and ad blocking features

### üîπ DuckDuckGo
Download [here](https://start.duckduckgo.com/).

**Pros:**
- user friendly
- good for privacy

**Cons:**
- lack of extension support
- DDG search engine pulls from Bing, which some users dislike

## üî∏ Search engines
Google is one of the worst offenders when it comes to surveillance capitalism.

### üîπ DuckDuckGo (DDG)
- most popular privacy-focused search engine
- doesn‚Äôt link your IP address to your identity
- blocks most third party cookies and trackers by default
- aggregates search results from Bing and DDG‚Äôs own indexing

### üîπ Start Page
Download [here](https://www.startpage.com/en/).

### üîπ Brave
Download [here](https://search.brave.com/).

### üîπ Kagi
Download [here](https://kagi.com/).

## üî∏ Extensions & add-ons
Be aware that extensions and add-ons can compromise your security. Thoroughly research extensions before installing.

### üîπ uBlock Origin
- blocks ads
- advanced mode can block scripts and is customizable
- supports filters that prevent website tracking from sites like Facebook
- uBlock Origin, along with other ad blockers, will be disabled when Chrome manifest v3 is released

### üîπ uBlock Origin Lite
- only use if uBlock Origin is unavailable

### üîπ ClearURLs

### üîπ Password manager

### üîπ VPN

## üî∏ Website cookies
Think of cookies as identifiers that tie your browsing activity to you. There are browser settings and extensions that will block third party cookies automatically. When a website asks you to accept cookies, choose ‚Äúreject‚Äù or ‚Äúnecessary cookies only.‚Äù

## üî∏ VPNs
**What:** A VPN is a virtual private network that can encrypt your internet traffic and masks your IP address.

**Why:** VPNs are useful when using public wifi or when you wish to mask your IP address while browsing the web. [Reasons to mask your IP address](https://usa.kaspersky.com/resource-center/preemptive-safety/how-to-hide-ip).

**What to look for:** Whether the VPN service logs/saves your activity and their reputation.

Select a VPN provider that does not log your activity. Confirm they don‚Äôt save user logs by checking if they‚Äôve been independently audited. Here are some providers who have been third party verified (based on this post) and are popular:

- [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/)
- [Surfshark](https://surfshark.com/)
- [ExpressVPN](https://www.expressvpn.com/)
- [Proton](https://protonvpn.com/)
- [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/en)
- [PIA](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/)

Mullvad accounts are randomly generated without your personal details, and they accept cash payment, meaning your account can‚Äôt easily be tied to you. Proton also accepts cash.

**Important:** People have the false impression that a VPN will keep them completely anonymous regardless of their online activity. This is incorrect.

**Consider this:** You post from a fake account on a forum, but you‚Äôre on a VPN, so your IP address is masked. However, you then place an online order for pizza delivery while still logged into the VPN. That IP address is now directly tied to your address and forum post.

**Takeaway:** A VPN masks your IP address but can still be linked to you based on your online activity. This is why disabling things like tracking and third party cookies is useful. If anonymity is your goal, check out [The Hitchhiker‚Äôs Guide](https://anonymousplanet.org/guide.htmlw).

## üî∏ Passwords
Passwords saved in an encrypted app, extension, or software that requires login credentials and 2FA/MFA are safer than in your browser. Always change default passwords and avoid reusing passwords. CISA's [best practices guide](https://www.cisa.gov/secure-our-world/use-strong-passwords).

### üîπ Passkeys

If setting up a passkey is an option, choose it over a password. More information [here](https://www.passkeys.com/passkey-vs-password).

## üî∏ Password Managers
**What:** Password managers store login credentials, contact details, secure notes, and more in an encrypted ‚Äúvault.‚Äù

**Why:** They enable you to save a lot of unique passwords that you don‚Äôt have to memorize.

**What to look for:** Reputation, features, and recent security breaches.

Apple and Google Passwords are secure if that‚Äôs your preference. The downside is if you lose access to your Apple ID or Google account, you‚Äôll lose access to all of your passwords.

Some popular password managers:

- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/)
- [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/)
- [NordPass](https://nordpass.com/)
- [1Password](https://1password.com/)

## üî∏ MFA / 2FA
**What:** Multi-factor (MFA) and 2-factor (2FA) authentication are an extra step to verifying your identity when you log into something.

**Why:** These measures help prevent unauthorized access to your accounts by requiring additional steps to log into an account.

**TL;DR:** Enable MFA and 2FA for everything.

There are four **types** of authentication, and a variety of **methods** to achieve each type.

| Type | Method(s) |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| something you know | password, PIN, security questions |
| something you have | one time password (OTP), authenticator app | 
| something you are | biometrics such as face ID or fingerprint | 
| somewhere you are | geolocation | 

Your username and password fall under the ‚Äúsomething you know‚Äù authentication **type**.

**2FA** requires you to present one (1) additional authentication **method** along with your username and password. 2FA allows you to use the same **type** of method (e.g. something you know, like a PIN or security question).

**MFA** requires you to present at least one (1) additional authentication **method** along with your username and password. However, the additional method cannot be the same **type**. For example, if you log in with a username/password, you cannot use a PIN, but you can use an authenticator app or biometrics.

MFA is more secure than 2FA, and both are more secure than single-factor authentication (just a username and password). Always choose MFA over 2FA if it's available.

# üî∂ Artificial Intelligence (AI)
If no AI haters exist, then I‚Äôm dead.

- [privacy concerns](https://iapp.org/news/a/shaping-the-future-a-dynamic-taxonomy-for-ai-privacy-risks)
- [steals from artists/creatives](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2024-06-18/artificial-intelligence-openai-media-manager-apple)
- [unsustainable resource consumption](https://www.vox.com/climate/2024/3/28/24111721/climate-ai-tech-energy-demand-rising)
- [generative AI uses more resources than task-specific tools](https://www.rwdigital.ca/blog/how-much-energy-do-google-search-and-chatgpt-use/)

AI can be a useful tool to those with disabilities, so abandoning it entirely is not an option for everyone. When most people think of AI, they think of generative AI, but narrow AI has been around for years. Generative AI poses a large risk to privacy. [Here‚Äôs the difference](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/07/24/the-difference-between-generative-ai-and-traditional-ai-an-easy-explanation-for-anyone/).

What you can do to protect your privacy:

- opt out of AI training
  - this [Wired guide](https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-stop-your-data-from-being-used-to-train-ai/) is a good place to start
- never provide personal information to AI tools like ChatGBT
- disable unused AI features on your devices

# üî∂ Phones
**Important:** Police may legally compel you to use biometrics to unlock your phone. Some courts currently consider the use of biometrics as a ‚Äúnontestimonial act.‚Äù

**Testimonial act:** Providing a password or PIN is considered a testimonial act because it involves revealing potentially incriminating information. Testimonial acts are protected by the 5th amendment.

**Nontestimonial act:** Using a fingerprint or facial recognition relies on physical characteristics instead of personal knowledge, and is therefore considered (in at least some recent court cases) a nontestimonial act. Nontestimonial acts are **not** protected by the 5th amendment.

With this in mind:

- leave your phone and smartwatch at home when attending protests
- consider manually disabling face ID / fingerprint when you‚Äôre outside of the home
- if you are stopped by police, and it‚Äôs safe to do so, turn off your phone
  - turning off your phone may prevent police from breaking into it with [Cellebrite](https://discuss.privacyguides.net/t/claims-made-by-forensics-companies-their-capabilities-and-how-grapheneos-fares/18445)
- for the safety of Black folks and other POC, you need your phone available to record police interactions
  - you may want to disable face ID / fingerprint instead
- on iOS, quickly [disable face ID](https://www.phonearena.com/news/How-to-force-iPhone-to-require-passcode-quickly-temporarily-disable-Face-ID_id121758) by triggering the ‚Äúpower off‚Äù screen, then canceling
- on Android, you can [enable lockdown mode from the lock screen](https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-disable-biometrics-on-your-android-phone-from-the-lock-screen)

I highly recommend that you restart your phone every day.

### üîπ General FYI
Please, PLEASE turn off your public activity on apps like Venmo. There is no good reason for your transactions to be public.
- [instructions for Venmo](https://www.wikihow.com/Delete-Venmo-History)

## üî∏ Phone Number Masking
Alternative to giving your actual phone number out. This Proton [blog post](https://protonvpn.com/blog/protect-your-privacy-with-second-phone-number-app/) offers tips on what to look for.

There is concern that data from period tracker apps could be used against someone who received an abortion. Even the Stardust app has been [guilty of sharing user data](https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/27/stardust-period-tracker-phone-number/). Here‚Äôs a 2022 [Wired article](https://www.wired.com/story/period-tracking-apps-flo-clue-stardust-ranked-data-privacy/) that covers the concern around period tracker privacy. Clue scored the highest, but doesn‚Äôt support local storage, which is a key privacy feature you should look for.

# üî∂ Computers
Most of you are probably not going to use Linux. I think Linux is the best option for security and usability. Consider [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) or [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/). This [TechRadar article](https://www.techradar.com/news/best-linux-distro-privacy-security) has some additional OS recommendations.

## üî∏ MacOS Settings

### üîπ FileVault
Full disk encryption prevents someone from exfiltrating data on your hard drive in the event your computer is seized or stolen. You must save your recovery key in a safe place that‚Äôs not on your computer‚Äôs hard drive.
- [instructions](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/protect-data-on-your-mac-with-filevault-mh11785/mac)

### üîπ Antivirus
MacOS has built-in protection tools that help prevent malware from being installed. Here‚Äôs an [explanation](https://www.macworld.com/article/670537/do-macs-need-antivirus.html) of those features and their shortfalls.

Full disk encryption prevents someone from exfiltrating data on your hard drive in the event your computer is seized or stolen. You must save your recovery key in a safe place that‚Äôs not on your computer‚Äôs hard drive.

Windows Defender is built-in and enough for 99% of people. You may wish to supplement it if you‚Äôre torrenting or downloading unofficial software.

Some options available for Windows:

### üîπ Automatic Updates
Regular software updates patch vulnerabilities.

## üî∏ Cloud Storage
The safest place your data can be stored is locally on your physical devices. If that‚Äôs not an option, it‚Äôs possible to improve cloud storage security.

**What to look for:** End to end encryption and what information could be handed over if subpoenaed.

iCloud, Google Drive, and OneDrive are considered safe, but you may want to activate advanced security settings. This [Wired guide](https://www.wired.com/story/9-tips-cloud-storage-security/) is a good starting point.
- [iCloud security overview](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102651)
- [Google Drive key security controls](https://cloud.google.com/docs/security/overview/whitepaper#key_security_controls)
- [OneDrive security overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/onedrive-privacy-security-overview)

These companies are required to comply with local regulations if subpoenaed. Consider manually encrypting sensitive files/folders. Use a long, complex password and store it in a fire safe AND password manager.
